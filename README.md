# A collection of interesting tricks in C

- macro
  - generic function: use _Generic macro to provide a uniform interface for different types
  - base 2 representation: use hex number to represent binary number
  - generic linked list: a generic linked list implemented using macro. The idea is taken from linked list in the Linux kernel. The same approach can be taken to implement other generic data structures. 
  - x-macro: interesting hack with c preprocessor, though hardly useful
  - indirect_stringify
