# A collection of interesting/useful tricks in C

- macro
  - [coroutine](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html): coroutine in C
  - generic function: use \_Generic macro to provide a uniform interface for different types
  - base 2 representation: use hex number to represent binary number
  - generic linked list: a generic linked list implemented using macro. The idea is taken from the linked list in Linux kernel. The same approach can be taken to implement other generic data structures. 
  - x-macro: interesting hack with c preprocessor, though hardly useful
  - indirect\_stringify
- misc
  - [Duff's device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device): This version of Duff's device is easier to understand than the original one. Interesting trick, but not useful anymore.
